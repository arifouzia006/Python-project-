# Tobacoo addiction among youth in different cities by comparing two machine learning models — Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
This project tries to find out if a young person smokes or not by looking at their health and personal details.
It also compares two computer methods — Logistic Regression and KNN — to see which one gives better results.
Step-by-step:
Data collection – The information comes from a file with details like:
Which city/state they live in
Gender
Blood pressure
Blood sugar
Cholesterol
Triglycerides
Hemoglobin level
Whether they smoke or not (yes/no)
Data preparation – Since computers work with numbers, words like "male" or "female", and city names are converted into numbers.
Training and testing – The data is split:
Training part – to teach the computer patterns.
Testing part – to check if the computer learned well.
Two methods are used –
Logistic Regression – a math formula that predicts yes/no answers.
KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) – looks at the nearest examples to guess the answer.
Checking accuracy –
The computer’s answers are compared with the real answers to see how correct it was.
Then both methods’ results are shown in numbers and a bar chart.
Conclusion –
Whichever method has higher accuracy is considered better for predicting smoking habits among youth
